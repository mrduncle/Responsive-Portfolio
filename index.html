						I have been programming as a sideline to my normal engineering job since teaching
						myself VBA for Excel in 2002. Once I developed enough confidence in my programming
						skills I would find myself encountering problems in my normal role that I could see
						a solution for. Then in my own time, I would set about resolving a programmatic answer
						to the problem. I still find myself as excited today about my latest programs as I was
						upon completing my first program and demonstrating it to my peers and managers (with
						the screen updating deliberately left on) in a weekly meeting. I find it immensely
						satisfying to create programs that will accomplish in a few seconds what would take
						hours or even days to perform manually.

						I have continued my self learning in the art of programming with Python, T-SQL, Access
						VBA along with supporting programs and technologies such as Visual Studio and Git. For
						the first time in my part time amateur programming career I am taking a course on full
						stack web development. I am very excited to finally have people to learn with as I
						struggle with a new bunch of languages.

						For me, it's all about the creative solutions you can bring to make the world a better
						place...or at least make someone's life a little easier. I also like whitewater kayaking.
